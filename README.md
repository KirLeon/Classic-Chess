# Classic-Chess
Mobile application for Android devices written in Java.

Hello. My name is Kirill and I am Intern Java Developer at Innowise Group.
I had some free time and I decided to spend it preparing to my degree work in college.
As a result, I want to present you this simple chess project. It was inspired by few decisions I have found at Github and wanted to improve.
I don't really like designing something visual and my front-end skills are quite bad, but I am back-end engineer in my heart, so first of all,
I wanted to make something that works correct. I don't like licenses e.t.c., so feel free to fork, download, use and improve this application.

So, yeah. COPYWRITE FREE NO LICENSE.

How to use:
Application required android version 8.0 (SDK version 26) or higher!
If you want to simple install it to your device and use it, you need to download .apk file on your android-based device, install it and you can enjoy playing chess whenever you want.

If you want to test, improve, fork and other things that required IDE and project code, you need to check next few steps:
1. Current project JAVA SDK version is 1.8 (Java 8). Please, be sure Java 8 or higher is supported and installed succesfully on your Device or/and IDE.
2. Most common way to develop android applicatons is to use Android Studio IDE. I use Android Studio Dolphin (2021.3.1 Patch 1). It is important to know your Android Studio version to verify the Gradle Version is supported for it. As I know, all versions that are newer than Dolphin (Electric Eel, Flamingo and Giraffe) are able to support Gradle 7.4 (min is Gradle 3.2).
3. This project uses Gradle 7.4. You can find gradle version settings in gradle-wrapper.properties. You can download and install Gradle from official site: https://gradle.org/releases/ or use your Android Studio Gradle plugin.
4. If everything is correct, you need to open Anroid Studio, press "New Project from VCS", enter there project URL ("https://github.com/KirLeon/Classic-Chess") and clone it. Everything will be downloaded automaticly. In case of errors during downloading (as usual for AS) check your SDK version, Gradle path and version, feel free to edit pathes for JDK, SDK and Gradle. In most cases you can easily find solution in Interner or via ChatGPT (I personally use it). Then you can build project, read comments, write test and everything your want.
5. If you have found better solutions to logic I used to make pieces move, improved readability, optimized project, prepared custom design decisions, made layouts for horizontal view, drew your own board and e.t.c. (or even implemented AI-based engine). Anything cool in your opinion. Feel free to send me pull requests and we can build better application (and world) together.
