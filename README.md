# Classic-Chess
Hello. My name is Kirill and I am Intern Java Developer at Innowise Group.
I had some free time and I decided to spend it preparing to my degree work in college.
As a result, I want to present you this simple chess project. It was inspired by few decisions I have found at Github and wanted to improve.
I don't really like designing something visual and my front-end skills are quite bad, but I am back-end engineer in my heart, so first of all,
I wanted to make something that works correct. I don't like licenses e.t.c., so feel free to fork, download, use and improve this application.

So, yeah. COPYWRITE FREE NO LICENSE.
